### Legacy assets

**Do not add new images to this directory.** This directory will be removed after GHES 3.0 is deprecated.

This directory stores images that were migrated to this repository from AWS S3. These images are not referenced directly in Markdown content. Images in this directory are rendered conditionally using a Unified.js plugin located at [`lib/render-content/plugins/rewite-legacy-asset-paths.js`](lib/render-content/plugins/rewite-legacy-asset-paths.js). When a page is rendered, the plugin checks whether the image referenced in the Markdown content (e.g., /assets/images/foo/bar.png) has a corresponding image in this directory for the version being rendered (e.g., /assets/images/enterprise/legacy-format/<ghes version>/assets/images/foo/bar.png. If a corresponding image does exist in the `legacy-format` directory, the image from the `legacy-format` directory is rendered. If not, the image path referenced in the Markdown is used (e.g., /assets/images/foo/bar.png).

This directory and the `rewrite-legacy-asset-paths` plugin will be removed when GHES 3.0 is deprecated in favor of single-sourcing the images referenced in Markdown, which requires versioning the images in the Markdown content using Liquid conditionals.
