# Content migration scripts

This directory stores scripts that modify content and/or data files. Because
writers are updating content all the time, scripts in here require more
cross-team coordination and planning before they are run. Make sure to consider
whether a script added here also needs to be run on translation files or if we
can wait for the changes to come in organically via Crowdin.
