# Scripts

## Scripts to rule them all

This directory follows the [Scripts to Rule Them All](https://githubengineering.com/scripts-to-rule-them-all/) pattern:

### [`bootstrap`](bootstrap)

Installs/updates all dependencies necessary for the docs environment. Equivalent of `npm install`.

---


### [`server`](server)

Starts the local development server. Equivalent of `npm start`.

To keep things snappy, only English and Japanese are enabled. To run the server with all languages enabled, run script/server-all-languages

---


### [`test`](test)

Runs tests. Equivalent of `npm test`.

---



## Additional scripts

### [`anonymize-branch.js`](anonymize-branch.js)

Flatten all the commits in the current branch into a single anonymized @Octomerger commit

Usage: script/anonymize-branch.js <new-commit-message> [base-branch] Example: script/anonymize-branch.js "nothing to see here" If the optional [base-branch] argument is omitted, it will default to `main`

---


### [`backfill-missing-localizations.js`](backfill-missing-localizations.js)

This script copies any English files that are missing from the translations directory into the translations directory. We only need to run this if problems occur with Crowdin's automatic sync.

---


### [`check-deps.js`](check-deps.js)

This script checks which modules you have used in your code and then makes sure they are listed as dependencies in your package.json, or vice-versa

https://github.com/dependency-check-team/dependency-check

The `ignore` array is for client-side or build-time stuff that doesn't get `require()d` in the normal way.

---


### [`check-english-links.js`](check-english-links.js)

This script runs once per day via a scheduled GitHub Action to check all links in English content, not including deprecated Enterprise Server content. It opens an issue if it finds broken links. To exclude a link path, add it to `lib/excluded-links.js`.

---


### [`check-for-node`](check-for-node)

This script is run automatically when you run the server locally. It checks whether Node.js is installed.

---


### [`check-internal-links.js`](check-internal-links.js)

This script runs in CI via GitHub Action to check all *internal* links in English content, not including deprecated Enterprise Server content. This is different from script/check-english-links.js, which checks *all* links in the site, both internal and external, and is much slower.
