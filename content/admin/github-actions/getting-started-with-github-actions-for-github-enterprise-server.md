This article explains how site administrators can configure {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} to use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. It covers the hardware and software requirements, presents the storage options, and describes the security management policies.

### Review hardware considerations

{% data reusables.actions.enterprise-hardware-considerations %}

{% endif %}

### External storage requirements

To enable {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, you must have access to external blob storage.

{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} uses blob storage to store artifacts generated by workflow runs, such as workflow logs and user-uploaded build artifacts. The amount of storage required depends on your usage of {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. Only a single external storage configuration is supported, and you can't use multiple storage providers at the same time.

{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} supports these storage providers:

* Azure Blob storage
* Amazon S3
* S3-compatible MinIO Gateway for NAS

{% note %}

**Note:** These are the only storage providers that {% data variables.product.company_short %} supports and can provide assistance with. Other S3 API-compatible storage providers are unlikely to work due to differences from the S3 API. [Contact us](https://support.github.com/contact) to request support for additional storage providers.

{% endnote %}

{% if currentVersion == "enterprise-server@2.22" %}
