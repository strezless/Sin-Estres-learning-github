{% data reusables.enterprise_installation.warning-on-upgrading-physical-resources %}

As more users join {% data variables.product.product_location %}, you may need to resize your storage volume. Refer to the documentation for your virtualization platform for information on resizing storage.

### Requirements and recommendations

{% note %}

**Note:** Before resizing the user storage volume, put your instance in maintenance mode. For more information, see "[Enabling and scheduling maintenance mode](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/admin/guides/installation/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode)."

{% endnote %}

#### Minimum requirements

{% data reusables.enterprise_installation.hardware-rec-table %}

### Increasing the data partition size

1. Resize the existing user volume disk using your virtualization platform's tools.
{% data reusables.enterprise_installation.ssh-into-instance %}
3. Put the appliance in maintenance mode. For more information, see "[Enabling and scheduling maintenance mode](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/admin/guides/installation/enabling-and-scheduling-maintenance-mode)."
4. Reboot the appliance to detect the new storage allocation.
5. Run the `ghe-storage-extend` command to expand the `/data/user` filesystem:
  ```shell
  $ ghe-storage-extend
  ```

### Increasing the root partition size using a new appliance

1. Set up a new {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance with a larger root disk using the same version as your current appliance. For more information, see "[Setting up a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/admin/guides/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance)."
2. Shut down the current appliance.
3. Detach the data disk from the current appliance using your virtualization platform's tools.
4. Attach the data disk to the new appliance with the larger root disk.

### Increasing the root partition size using an existing appliance

1. Attach a new disk to your {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} appliance.
2. Run the `parted` command to format the disk:
  ```shell
  $ sudo parted /dev/xvdg mklabel msdos
  $ sudo parted /dev/xvdg mkpart primary ext4 0% 50%
  $ sudo parted /dev/xvdg mkpart primary ext4 50% 100%
  ```
3. Run the `ghe-upgrade` command to install a full, platform specific package to the newly partitioned disk. A universal hotpatch upgrade package, such as `github-enterprise-2.11.9.hpkg`, will not work as expected.
  ```shell
  $ ghe-upgrade PACKAGE-NAME.pkg -s -t /dev/xvdg1
  ```
4. Shut down the appliance.
5. In the hypervisor, remove the old root disk and attach the new root disk at the same location as the old root disk.
6. Start the appliance.
