When you open an issue from code, the issue contains a snippet showing the line or range of code you chose. You can only open an issue in the same repository where the code is stored.

{% data reusables.repositories.administrators-can-disable-issues %}

{% data reusables.repositories.navigate-to-repo %}
2. Locate the code you want to reference in an issue:
    - To open an issue about code in a file, navigate to the file.
    - To open an issue about code in a pull request, navigate to the pull request and click {% octicon "diff" aria-label="The file diff icon" %} **Files changed**. Then, browse to the file that contains the code you want include in your comment, and click **View**.
{% data reusables.repositories.choose-line-or-range %}
4. To the left of the code range, click {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The horizontal kebab octicon" %}. In the drop-down menu, click **Reference in new issue**.
