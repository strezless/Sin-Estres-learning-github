### Discovering relevant projects

If there's a particular topic that interests you, visit `github.com/topics/<topic>`. For example, if you are interested in machine learning, you can find relevant projects and good first issues by visiting https://github.com/topics/machine-learning. You can browse popular topics by visiting [Topics](https://github.com/topics). You can also search for repositories that match a topic you're interested in. For more information, see "[Searching for repositories](/articles/searching-for-repositories#search-by-topic)."

If you've been active on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you can find personalized recommendations for projects and good first issues based on your past contributions, stars, and other activities in [Explore](https://github.com/explore). You can also sign up for the Explore newsletter to receive emails about opportunities to contribute to {% data variables.product.product_name %} based on your interests. To sign up, see [Explore email newsletter](https://github.com/explore/subscribe).

Keep up with recent activity from repositories you watch and people you follow in the "All activity" section of your personal dashboard. For more information, see "[About your personal dashboard](/articles/about-your-personal-dashboard)."

### Finding good first issues

If you already know what project you want to work on, you can find beginner-friendly issues in that repository by visiting `github.com/<owner>/<repository>/contribute`. For an example, you can find ways to make your first contribution to `electron/electron` at https://github.com/electron/electron/contribute.
