Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

#### Propose changes to someone else's project

For example, you can use forks to propose changes related to fixing a bug. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

- Fork the repository.
- Make the fix.
- Submit a pull request to the project owner.

#### Use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

Open source software is based on the idea that by sharing code, we can make better, more reliable software. For more information, see the "[About the Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/about)" on the Open Source Initiative.

For more information about applying open source principles to your organization's development work on {% data variables.product.product_location %}, see {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}'s white paper "[An introduction to innersource](https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/introduction-to-innersource/)."

{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" or enterpriseServerVersions contains currentVersion %}

When creating your public repository from a fork of someone's project, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others. For more information, see "[Choose an open source license](http://choosealicense.com/)" at choosealicense.com.

**Tip**: You can also fork a repository using the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}. For more information, see "[`gh repo fork`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_fork)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} documentation.

### Fork an example repository

Forking a repository is a simple two-step process. We've created a repository for you to practice with.

1. On {% data variables.product.product_location %}, navigate to the [octocat/Spoon-Knife](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife) repository.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Fork**.

### Keep your fork synced

You might fork a project to propose changes to the upstream, or original, repository. In this case, it's good practice to regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository. To do this, you'll need to use Git on the command line. You can practice setting the upstream repository using the same [octocat/Spoon-Knife](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife) repository you just forked.

#### Step 1: Set up Git

If you haven't yet, you should first [set up Git](/articles/set-up-git). Don't forget to [set up authentication to {% data variables.product.product_location %} from Git](/articles/set-up-git#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git) as well.

#### Step 2: Create a local clone of your fork

Right now, you have a fork of the Spoon-Knife repository, but you don't have the files in that repository on your computer. Let's create a clone of your fork locally on your computer.

1. On {% data variables.product.product_name %}, navigate to **your fork** of the Spoon-Knife repository.
{% data reusables.repositories.copy-clone-url %}
{% data reusables.command_line.open_the_multi_os_terminal %}
{% data reusables.command_line.change-current-directory-clone %}
4. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your {% data variables.product.product_name %} username instead of `YOUR-USERNAME`:
  ```shell
  $ git clone https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>YOUR-USERNAME</em>/Spoon-Knife
  ```

5. Press **Enter**. Your local clone will be created.
  ```shell
  $ git clone https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>YOUR-USERNAME</em>/Spoon-Knife
  > Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`...
  > remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
  > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
  > remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
  > Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
  ```

Now, you have a local copy of your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository.

#### Step 3: Configure Git to sync your fork with the original Spoon-Knife repository

When you fork a project in order to propose changes to the original repository, you can configure Git to pull changes from the original, or upstream, repository into the local clone of your fork.

1. On {% data variables.product.product_name %}, navigate to the [octocat/Spoon-Knife](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife) repository.
{% data reusables.repositories.copy-clone-url %}
{% data reusables.command_line.open_the_multi_os_terminal %}
4. Change directories to the location of the fork you cloned in [Step 2: Create a local clone of your fork](#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork).
    - To go to your home directory, type just `cd` with no other text.
    - To list the files and folders in your current directory, type `ls`.
    - To go into one of your listed directories, type `cd your_listed_directory`.
    - To go up one directory, type `cd ..`.
5. Type `git remote -v` and press **Enter**. You'll see the current configured remote repository for your fork.
  ```shell
  $ git remote -v
  > origin  https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>YOUR_USERNAME</em>/<em>YOUR_FORK</em>.git (fetch)
  > origin  https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>YOUR_USERNAME</em>/<em>YOUR_FORK</em>.git (push)
  ```

6. Type `git remote add upstream`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2 and press **Enter**. It will look like this:
  ```shell
  $ git remote add upstream https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git
  ```

7. To verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork, type `git remote -v` again. You should see the URL for your fork as `origin`, and the URL for the original repository as `upstream`.
  ```shell
  $ git remote -v
  > origin    https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>YOUR_USERNAME</em>/<em>YOUR_FORK</em>.git (fetch)
  > origin    https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>YOUR_USERNAME</em>/<em>YOUR_FORK</em>.git (push)
  > upstream  https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>ORIGINAL_OWNER</em>/<em>ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY</em>.git (fetch)
  > upstream  https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>ORIGINAL_OWNER</em>/<em>ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY</em>.git (push)
  ```

Now, you can keep your fork synced with the upstream repository with a few Git commands. For more information, see "[Syncing a fork](/articles/syncing-a-fork)."

#### Next steps

You can make any changes to a fork, including:

- **Creating branches:** [*Branches*](/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) allow you to build new features or test out ideas without putting your main project at risk.
- **Opening pull requests:** If you are hoping to contribute back to the original repository, you can send a request to the original author to pull your fork into their repository by submitting a [pull request](/articles/about-pull-requests).

### Find another repository to fork

Fork a repository to start contributing to a project. {% data reusables.repositories.you-can-fork %}

{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" %}You can browse [Explore](https://github.com/explore) to find projects and start contributing to open source repositories. For more information, see "[Finding ways to contribute to open source on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](/github/getting-started-with-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)."

{% endif %}

### Celebrate

You have now forked a repository, practiced cloning your fork, and configured an upstream repository. What do you want to do next?
