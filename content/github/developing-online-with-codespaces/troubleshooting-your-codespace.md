If you encounter issues while using a browser that is not Chromium-based, try switching to a Chromium-based browser, or check for known issues with your browser in the `microsoft/vscode` repository by searching for issues labeled with the name of your browser, such as[`firefox`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afirefox) or [`safari`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asafari).

If you encounter issues while using a Chromium-based browser, you can check if you're experiencing another known issue with {% data variables.product.prodname_vscode %} in the [`microsoft/vscode`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) repository.

If you still need help, you can contact us. For more information, see "[About {% data variables.product.prodname_codespaces %}](/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-codespaces#contacting-us-about-codespaces)."
