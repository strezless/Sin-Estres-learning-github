### About navigating code on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}

Code navigation uses the open source library [`tree-sitter`](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter). The following languages are supported:
- C#
- CodeQL
- Go
- Java
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Python
- Ruby
- TypeScript

{% note %}

**Note**: Code navigation works for active branches. If the feature is enabled for you but you don't see links to the definitions of functions and methods, push to the branch and try again.

{% endnote %}

### Jumping to the definition of a function or method

You can jump to a function or method's definition within the same repository by clicking the function or method call in a file.
