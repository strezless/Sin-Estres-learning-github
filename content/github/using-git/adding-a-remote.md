The `git remote add` command takes two arguments:

* A remote name, for example, `origin`
* A remote URL, for example, `https://{% data variables.command_line.backticks %}/user/repo.git`

For example:

```shell
$ git remote add origin https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>user</em>/<em>repo</em>.git
# Set a new remote

$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote
> origin  https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>user</em>/<em>repo</em>.git (fetch)
> origin  https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>user</em>/<em>repo</em>.git (push)
```

Not sure which URL to use?  Check out "[Which remote URL should I use?](/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use)"

### Troubleshooting

You may encounter these errors when trying to add a remote.

#### Remote `name` already exists

This error means you've tried to add a remote with a name that already exists in your local repository:

```shell
$ git remote add origin https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git
> fatal: remote origin already exists.
```

To fix this, you can

* Use a different name for the new remote
* [Rename the existing remote](/articles/renaming-a-remote)
* [Delete the existing remote](/articles/removing-a-remote)
