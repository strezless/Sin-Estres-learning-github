{% tip %}

**Tip**: If you want to cancel your paid subscription, you can [downgrade your organization to {% data variables.product.prodname_free_team %}](/articles/downgrading-your-github-subscription) instead of deleting the organization and its content.

{% endtip %}

{% endif %}

### 1. Back up your organization content

Once you delete an organization, GitHub **cannot restore your content**. Therefore, before you delete your organization, make sure you have a copy of all repositories, wikis, issues, and project boards from the account.

### 2. Delete the organization

{% data reusables.profile.access_profile %}
{% data reusables.profile.access_org %}
{% data reusables.organizations.org_settings %}
4. Near the bottom of the organization's settings page, click **Delete this Organization**.
