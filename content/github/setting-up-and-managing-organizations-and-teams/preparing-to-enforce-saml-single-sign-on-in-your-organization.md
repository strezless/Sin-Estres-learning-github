When you [enforce SAML single sign-on](/articles/enabling-and-testing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization) in your organization, members that haven't authenticated via your identity provider (IdP) will be removed from the organization and will receive an email notifying them about the removal.

Before enforcing SAML SSO in your organization, you should:

- [Add](/articles/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization) or [remove](/articles/removing-a-member-from-your-organization) members from your organization if needed.
- If you haven't already, connect your IdP to your organization. For more information, see "[Connecting your identity provider to your organization](/articles/connecting-your-identity-provider-to-your-organization)."
- Ensure that your organization members have signed in and linked their accounts with the IdP.
