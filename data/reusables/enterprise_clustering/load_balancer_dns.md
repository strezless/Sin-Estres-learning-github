DNS lookups for the {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} hostname should resolve to the load balancer. We recommend that you enable subdomain isolation. If subdomain isolation is enabled, an additional wildcard record (`*.HOSTNAME`) should also resolve to the load balancer. For more information, see "[Enabling subdomain isolation](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/admin/guides/installation/enabling-subdomain-isolation/)."
