If you choose **Allow select actions**, local actions are allowed, and there are additional options for allowing other specific actions. For more information, see "[Allowing specific actions to run](#allowing-specific-actions-to-run)."

When you allow local actions only, the policy blocks all access to actions authored by {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. For example, the [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) would not be accessible.
