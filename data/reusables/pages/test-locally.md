Changes to your site are published automatically when the changes are merged into your site's publishing source. If you want to preview your changes first, you can make the changes locally instead of on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. Then, test your site locally. For more information, see "[Testing your {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} site locally with Jekyll](/articles/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)."
