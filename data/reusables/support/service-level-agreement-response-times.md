### Service Level Agreement response times

For tickets you submit, support is available 24 hours a day, 7 days per week. The initial response time guaranteed by the SLA is dependent on the priority level of the ticket. Response time begins when {% data variables.contact.premium_support %} sets the priority level of the ticket. A response does not mean the issue has been resolved.

| Ticket priority level | Initial response time |
| --- | ---|
| {% data variables.product.support_ticket_priority_urgent %} | 30 minutes |
| {% data variables.product.support_ticket_priority_high %} | 4 hours |
