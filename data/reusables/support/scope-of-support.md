### Scope of support

If your support request is outside of the scope of what our team can help you with, we may recommend next steps to resolve your issue outside of {% data variables.contact.github_support %}. Your support request is possibly out of {% data variables.contact.github_support %}'s scope if the request is primarily about:
- Third party integrations
- Hardware setup
- CI/CD, such as Jenkins
- Writing scripts
- Configuration of external authentication systems, such as SAML identity providers
- Open Source projects

If you're uncertain if the issue is out of scope, open a ticket and we're happy to help you determine the best way to proceed.
