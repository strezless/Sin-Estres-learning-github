The *client.js* script looks for the `POSTGRES_HOST` and `POSTGRES_PORT` environment variables to create the client. The workflow sets those two environment variables as part of the "Connect to PostgreSQL" step to make them available to the *client.js* script. For more information about the script, see "[Testing the PostgreSQL service container](#testing-the-postgresql-service-container)."
