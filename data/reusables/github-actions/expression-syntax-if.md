When you use expressions in an `if` conditional, you may omit the expression syntax ({% raw %}`${{ }}`{% endraw %}) because {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} automatically evaluates the `if` conditional as an expression, unless the expression contains any operators. If the expression contains any operators, the expression must be contained within {% raw %}`${{ }}`{% endraw %} to explicitly mark it for evaluation.
