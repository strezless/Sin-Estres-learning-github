Bandwidth and storage usage only count against the repository owner's quotas. In forks, bandwidth and storage usage count against the root of the repository network. Anyone with write access to a repository can push files to {% data variables.large_files.product_name_short %} without affecting their personal bandwidth and storage quotas or purchasing data packs. Forking and pulling a repository counts against the parent repository's bandwidth limit.
