When you close a project board, any workflow automation configured for the project board will pause. If you reopen a project board, you have the option to sync automation, which updates the position of the cards on the board according to the automation settings configured for the board. For more information, see "[Reopening a closed project board](/articles/reopening-a-closed-project-board)" or "[Closing a project board](/articles/closing-a-project-board)."
