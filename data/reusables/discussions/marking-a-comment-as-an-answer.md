You can mark a comment in the discussion as an answer to the discussion if a discussion is within a category that accepts answers. For more information, see "[About discussions](/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions#about-categories-and-formats-for-discussions)."

When you mark a question as an answer, {% data variables.product.product_name %} will highlight the comment and replies to the comment to help visitors quickly find the answer.
