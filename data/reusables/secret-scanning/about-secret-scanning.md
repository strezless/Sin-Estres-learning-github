If someone checks a secret from a {% data variables.product.company_short %} partner into a {% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" %}public or private{% endif %} repository on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} catches the secret as it's checked in, and helps you mitigate the impact of the leak. 
Repository administrators are notified about any commit that contains a secret, and they can quickly view all detected secrets in the Security tab for the repository.
