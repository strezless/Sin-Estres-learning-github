Puedes crear hasta diez niveles de patrocinio que podrán escoger los patrocinadores. Each tier has its own monthly or one-time payment amount in US dollars and benefits, such as receiving early access to new versions or being featured in the project's README. In addition, you can choose to enable tiers for custom amounts (monthly and one-time).

Una vez que hayas publicado un nivel, no podrás editar el precio de este. En vez de eso, deberás retirar el nivel y crear uno nuevo. Existing sponsors will remain on the retired tier until they change their sponsorship tier, cancel their sponsorship, or their one-time sponsorship period expires.
