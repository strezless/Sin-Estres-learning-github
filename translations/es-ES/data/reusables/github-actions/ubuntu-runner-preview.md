**Note:** The `ubuntu-latest` label is currently being migrated from the Ubuntu 18.04 virtual environment to Ubuntu 20.04. Specifying the `ubuntu-latest` label during the migration might use either virtual environment. To explicitly use Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu 18.04, specify `ubuntu-20.04` or `ubuntu-18.04`. When the migration is complete, `ubuntu-latest` will use the Ubuntu 20.04 virtual environment. For more information about the migration, see "[Ubuntu-latest workflows will use Ubuntu-20.04](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/1816)."
