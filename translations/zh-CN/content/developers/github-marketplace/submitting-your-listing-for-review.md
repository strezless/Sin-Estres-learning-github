Once you've completed your app listing, you'll see two buttons that allow you to submit an unverified and verified app. The Publish without Verification **Request** button will not be available if you have published any paid pricing plans.

Before you can submit a verified app, you'll need to integrate the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} billing flows and webhook into your existing app. See [Verified apps](/marketplace/#verified-apps) for the steps required to submit your app.

If you've met the [requirements](/marketplace/getting-started/requirements-for-listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/) for a verified {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} listing and you've integrated with the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} API, go ahead and submit your listing!

After you submit your listing for review, the {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} onboarding team will reach out to you with additional information.
