      Users may experience assets such as avatars not loading, or a failure to push/pull code. This may be caused by a PID mismatch in the `haproxy-cluster-proxy` service. To determine if you have an affected instance:

      **Single instance**

      1. Run this in the [administrative shell](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/configuration/accessing-the-administrative-shell-ssh) (SSH):

        ```
        if [ $(cat /var/run/haproxy-cluster-proxy.pid) -ne $(systemctl show --property MainPID --value haproxy-cluster-proxy) ]; then echo 'Main PID of haproxy-cluster-proxy does not match /var/run/haproxy-cluster-proxy.pid'; fi
        ```

      2. If it shows that there is a mismatch, reboot the instance.

      **Cluster or High Availability configuration**

      1. Run this in the [administrative shell](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/configuration/accessing-the-administrative-shell-ssh) (SSH):

        ```
        ghe-cluster-each -- 'if [ $(cat /var/run/haproxy-cluster-proxy.pid) -ne $(systemctl show --property MainPID --value haproxy-cluster-proxy) ]; then echo 'Main PID of haproxy-cluster-proxy does not match /var/run/haproxy-cluster-proxy.pid'; fi'
        ```

      2. If it shows one or more nodes are affected, reboot the affected nodes.
