    - '**HIGH:** An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed authenticated users of the instance to gain write access to unauthorized repositories via specifically crafted pull requests and REST API requests. An attacker would need to be able to fork the targeted repository, a setting that is disabled by default for organization owned private repositories. Branch protections such as required pull request reviews or status checks would prevent unauthorized commits from being merged without further review or validation. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22861. This issue was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).'
    - '**HIGH:** An improper access control vulnerability was identified in the GitHub Enterprise Server GraphQL API that allowed authenticated users of the instance to modify the maintainer collaboration permission of a pull request without proper authorization. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker would be able to gain access to head branches of pull requests opened on repositories of which they are a maintainer. Forking is disabled by default for organization owned private repositories and would prevent this vulnerability. Additionally, branch protections such as required pull request reviews or status checks would prevent unauthorized commits from being merged without further review or validation. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22863. This issue was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).'
    - '**HIGH:** A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages site. User-controlled configuration of the underlying parsers used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to execute commands on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-10519 and was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com).'
    - '**LOW:** A specially crafted request to the SVN bridge could trigger a long wait before failure resulting in Denial of Service (DoS).'
    - '包已更新到最新的安全版本。'

    - 'Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.'
    - 'Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository where the file path is longer than 255 characters.'
