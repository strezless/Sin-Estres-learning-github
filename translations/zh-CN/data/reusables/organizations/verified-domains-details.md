To display a "Verified" badge, the website and email information shown on an organization's profile must match the verified domain or domains. 如果组织资料中显示的网站和电子邮件地址在不同的域中托管，则必须验证两个域。 If the website and email address use variants of the same domain, you must verify both variants. For example, if the profile shows the website `www.example.com` and the email address `info@example.com`, you would need to verify both `www.example.com` and `example.com`.
