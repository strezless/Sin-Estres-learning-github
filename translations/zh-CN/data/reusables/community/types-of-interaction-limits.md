There are three types of interaction limits.
   - **Limit to existing users（限于现有用户）**：限制帐户存在时间不到 24 小时、之前没有贡献也不是协作者的用户的活动。
   - **Limit to prior contributors**: Limits activity for users who have not previously contributed to the default branch of the repository and are not collaborators.
   - **Limit to repository collaborators**: Limits activity for users who do not have write access to the repository.
