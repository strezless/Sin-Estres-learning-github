**Note:** For security reasons, public repositories can't use runners in a runner group by default, but you can override this in the runner group's settings. 更多信息请参阅“[使用组管理对自托管运行器的访问](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups#changing-the-access-policy-of-a-self-hosted-runner-group)”。
