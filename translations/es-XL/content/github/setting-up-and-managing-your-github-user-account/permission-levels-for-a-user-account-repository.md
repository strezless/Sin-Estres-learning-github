**Tip:** If you require more granular read/write access to a repository owned by your user account, consider transferring the repository to an organization. For more information, see "[Transferring a repository](/articles/transferring-a-repository)."

#### Collaborator access on a repository owned by a user account

{% note %}

**Note:** In a private repository, repository owners can only grant write access to collaborators. Collaborators can't have read-only access to repositories owned by a user account.

{% endnote %}

Collaborators on a personal repository can:

- Push to (write), pull from (read), and fork (copy) the repository
- Create, apply, and delete labels and milestones
- Open, close, re-open, and assign issues
- Edit and delete comments on commits, pull requests, and issues
- Mark an issue or pull request as a duplicate. For more information, see "[About duplicate issues and pull requests](/articles/about-duplicate-issues-and-pull-requests)."
- Open, merge and close pull requests
- Apply suggested changes to pull requests. For more information, see "[Incorporating feedback in your pull request](/articles/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)."
- Send pull requests from forks of the repository{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" %}
- Publish, view, and install packages. For more information, see "[Publishing and managing packages](/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/publishing-and-managing-packages)."{% endif %}
- Create and edit Wikis
- Create and edit releases. For more information, see "[Managing releases in a repository](/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository).
- Remove themselves as collaborators on the repository
- Submit a review on a pull request that will affect its mergeability
- Act as a designated code owner for the repository. For more information, see "[About code owners](/articles/about-code-owners)."
- Lock a conversation. For more information, see "[Locking conversations](/articles/locking-conversations)."{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" %}
