#### Search based on time of action

Use the `created` qualifier to filter actions in the audit log based on when they occurred. {% data reusables.time_date.date_format %} {% data reusables.time_date.time_format %}

{% data reusables.search.date_gt_lt %} For example:

  * `created:2014-07-08` finds all events that occurred on July 8th, 2014.
  * `created:>=2014-07-08` finds all events that occurred on or after July 8th, 2014.
  * `created:<=2014-07-08` finds all events that occurred on or before July 8th, 2014.
  * `created:2014-07-01..2014-07-31` finds all events that occurred in the month of July 2014.

The audit log contains data for the past 90 days, but you can use the `created` qualifier to search for events earlier than that.

#### Search based on location

Using the qualifier `country`, you can filter actions in the audit log based on the originating country. You can use a country's two-letter short code or its full name. Keep in mind that countries with spaces in their name will need to be wrapped in quotation marks. For example:

  * `country:de` finds all events that occurred in Germany.
  * `country:Mexico` finds all events that occurred in Mexico.
  * `country:"United States"` all finds events that occurred in the United States.

### Exporting the audit log

{% data reusables.audit_log.export-log %}
{% data reusables.audit_log.exported-log-keys-and-values %}
{% endif %}

### Using the Audit log API

{% note %}

**Note**: The Audit log API is available for organizations using {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}. {% data reusables.gated-features.more-info-org-products %}

{% endnote %}

To ensure a secure IP and maintain compliance for your organization, you can use the Audit log API to keep copies of your audit log data and monitor:
* Access to your organization or repository settings.
* Changes in permissions.
* Added or removed users in an organization, repository, or team.
* Users being promoted to admin.
* Changes to permissions of a GitHub App.

The GraphQL response can include data for up to 90 to 120 days.

For example, you can make a GraphQL request to see all the new organization members added to your organization. For more information, see the "[GraphQL API Audit Log](/graphql/reference/interfaces#auditentry/)."
