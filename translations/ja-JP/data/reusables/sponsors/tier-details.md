スポンサーが選択できる層として、最大で10個のスポンサーシップ層を作成できます。 Each tier has its own monthly or one-time payment amount in US dollars and benefits, such as receiving early access to new versions or being featured in the project's README. In addition, you can choose to enable tiers for custom amounts (monthly and one-time).

Once you have published a tier, you can't edit the price of that tier. その代わりに、その層を止めて新しい層を作成できます。 Existing sponsors will remain on the retired tier until they change their sponsorship tier, cancel their sponsorship, or their one-time sponsorship period expires.
