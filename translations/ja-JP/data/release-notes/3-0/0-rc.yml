      heading: Advanced Security Code Scanning
      notes:
        - |
          [GitHub Advanced Security code scanning](https://github.com/features/security) is now generally available on GitHub Enterprise Server. Organizations who have purchased Advanced Security can use this capability to do static analysis security testing against their code, and prevent vulnerabilities from making it to their production code using CodeQL, our semantic analysis engine. For more information, see "[Configuring code scanning on your appliance](/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/configuration/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#running-code-scanning-using-github-actions)"
  changes:
    - 
      heading: Administration Changes
      notes:
        - The webhook events delivery system has been rearchitected for higher throughput, faster deliveries, and fewer delayed messages. It also uses less CPU and memory in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.0+.
        - Organization and Enterprise owners can now see when a team member has been promoted to or demoted from being a team maintainer in the audit log through the new `team.promote_maintainer` and `team.demote_maintainer` audit log events. For more information, see "[Audited actions](/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/user-management/audited-actions)."
        - 'Repository maintainers with existing {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites can [easily update their prior default branch name](/enterprise-server@3.0/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites).'
        - Additional hardware resources are required to run {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} with any of Actions, Packages or Advanced Security enabled. For more infomation on the minimum required resources for each supported platform, see "[Setting up a {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instance](/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance)."
        - Administrators can now [publish a message](/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/user-management/customizing-user-messages-for-your-enterprise), which all users must accept. This can help to onboard new users and surface other organization-specific information and policies.
    - 
      heading: Security Changes
      notes:
        - Organization owners can now disable publication of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites from repositories in the organization. Disabling {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} for the organization will prevent members from creating new Pages sites but will not unpublish existing sites. For more information, see "[Disabling publication of {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} sites for your organization](/enterprise-server@3.0/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/disabling-publication-of-github-pages-sites-for-your-organization)."
        - A datacenter must be explicitly defined on all nodes before enabling an active replica.
        - All usage of SSH fingerprints has been switched to use SHA256 fingerprints as they are used with OpenSSH since version 6.8 as well. This applies to the web interface and also the API where fingerprints are returned such as in GraphQL. The fingerprints follow the OpenSSH format.
        - SHA-1 and SHA-256 signature headers (two headers) are sent on webhooks.
    - 
      heading: Developer Changes
      notes:
        - Majority of the services running in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.0+ are now on containers which internally enables GitHub to iterate fast and ship high quality releases
        - The webhook events delivery system has been rearchitected for higher throughput, faster deliveries, and fewer delayed messages.
    - 
      heading: API の変更
      notes:
        - 'Administrators can now configure and manage the site-wide announcement banner via the REST API. For more information, see the endpoints for "[GitHub Enterprise administration](/enterprise-server@3.0/rest/reference/enterprise-admin#annoucements)."'
    - 
      heading: Default branch renaming
      notes:
        - |
          Enterprise and organization administrators can now set the default branch name for new repositories. Enterprise administrators can also enforce their choice of default branch name across all organizations or allow individual organizations to choose their own.

          Existing repositories are unaffected by these settings, and their default branch name will not be changed.

          {% note %}

          The default branch for newly-created repositories will be set to `main` in GHES 3.1, unless you opt out by setting the default branch setting at the enterprise level.

          {% endnote %}

          This change is one of many changes GitHub is making to support projects and maintainers that want to rename their default branch. To learn more about the changes we're making, see [github/renaming](https://github.com/github/renaming).
  bugs:
    - The format of several log files have changed, including the addition of a PID for different log types. This does not affect how GitHub Enterprise Support uses support bundles to troubleshoot issues.
    - A PATCH request to the webhook configuration API no longer erases the webhook secret.
  deprecations:
    - 
      heading: Deprecation of GitHub Enterprise Server 2.19
      notes:
        - '**{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 2.19 is deprecated as of November 12, 2020**. That means that no patch releases will be made, even for critical security issues, after this date. For better performance, improved security, and new features, [upgrade to the newest version of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}](https://help.github.com/enterprise/admin/guides/installation/upgrading-github-enterprise/) as soon as possible.'
    - 
      heading: Deprecation of Legacy GitHub App Webhook Events
      notes:
        - Starting with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 2.21.0 two legacy GitHub Apps-related webhook events have been deprecated and will be removed in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.2.0. The deprecated events `integration_installation` and `integration_installation_repositories` have equivalent events which will be supported. More information is available in the [deprecation announcement blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-04-15-replacing-the-installation-and-installation-repositories-events/).
    - 
      heading: Deprecation of Legacy GitHub Apps Endpoint
      notes:
        - Starting with {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 2.21.0 the legacy GitHub Apps endpoint for creating installation access tokens was deprecated and will be removed in {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.2.0.  More information is available in the [deprecation announcement blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-04-15-replacing-create-installation-access-token-endpoint/).
    - 
      heading: Deprecation of OAuth Application API
      notes:
        - GitHub no longer supports the OAuth application endpoints that contain `access_token` as a path parameter. We have introduced new endpoints that allow you to securely manage tokens for OAuth Apps by moving `access_token` to the request body. While deprecated, the endpoints are still accessible in this version. We intend to remove these endpoints on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.4. For more information, see the [deprecation announcement blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/).
    - 
      heading: Deprecation of support for Semiotic
      notes:
        - The service supported a "Find by Symbol" experience in the pull request view that was not widely used.
    - 
      heading: Deprecation of workflow commands
      notes:
        - '{% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} `set-env` and `add-path` workflow commands have been deprecated. For more information, see the [changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-01-github-actions-deprecating-set-env-and-add-path-commands/).'
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - Release Candidate 1 does not support Cluster mode.
    - Custom firewall rules are not maintained during an upgrade.
    - Git LFS tracked files [uploaded through the web interface](https://github.blog/2016-02-18-upload-files-to-your-repositories/) are incorrectly added directly to the repository.
    - When "Users can search GitHub.com" is enabled with GitHub Connect, issues in private and internal repositories are not included in GitHub.com search results.
    - Following an unsuccessful attempt to set up Actions, if you then disable Actions you will not be able to create the first user and use the appliance
    - The "Mandatory message viewed" audit log event is not being saved
    - '`ghe-config-apply` must be run on a replica during first setup before `ghe-repl-setup` can be run to start replication.'
    - Backup-utils can trigger unnecessary emails to administrators
    - Incorrect Packages settings are being displayed in the Organization member view page
    - After removing oneself as an Enterprise Owner, you are redirected to a 404 page. The operation is successful.
    - '`ghe-config-apply` occassionally fails with `ERROR: Failure waiting for nomad jobs to apply` until the Nomad job queue is cleared. This currently requires as admin to delete `/etc/nomad-jobs/queue`.'
    - When configuring a multiple replica node, the status of the replica can be incorrectly synchronized.
    - Customers attempting to restore a 3.0 backup to a new instance should not pre-configure the instance, as it may lead to a bad state for user logins. We recommend restoring to a fresh, unconfigured instance.
    - GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0 release candidates are not yet available in the Azure marketplace. To test RC1 in staging environments, start a 2.21 or 2.22 instance, and then upgrade it with the Azure upgrade package on the download page.
  backups:
    - '{% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} 3.0 requires at least [GitHub Enterprise Backup Utilities 3.0.0](https://github.com/github/backup-utils) for [Backups and Disaster Recovery](/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/configuration/configuring-backups-on-your-appliance).'
