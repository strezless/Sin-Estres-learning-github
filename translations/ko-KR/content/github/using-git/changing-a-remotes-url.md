{% tip %}

**Tip:** For information on the difference between HTTPS and SSH URLs, see "[Which remote URL should I use?](/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use)"

{% endtip %}

The `git remote set-url` command takes two arguments:

* An existing remote name. For example, `origin` or `upstream` are two common choices.
* A new URL for the remote. 예시:
  * If you're updating to use HTTPS, your URL might look like:
```shell
https://{% data variables.command_line.backticks %}/<em>USERNAME</em>/<em>REPOSITORY</em>.git
```
  * If you're updating to use SSH, your URL might look like:
```shell
git@{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}:<em>USERNAME</em>/<em>REPOSITORY</em>.git
```

2. Change the current working directory to your local project.
3. List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.
  ```shell
  $ git remote -v
  > origin  git@{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}:<em>USERNAME/REPOSITORY</em>.git (fetch)
  > origin  git@{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}:<em>USERNAME/REPOSITORY</em>.git (push)
  ```
4. Change your remote's URL from SSH to HTTPS with the `git remote set-url` command.
  ```shell
  $ git remote set-url origin https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>USERNAME</em>/<em>REPOSITORY</em>.git
  ```
5. Verify that the remote URL has changed.
  ```shell
  $ git remote -v
  # Verify new remote URL
  > origin  https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>USERNAME/REPOSITORY</em>.git (fetch)
  > origin  https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>USERNAME/REPOSITORY</em>.git (push)
  ```

The next time you `git fetch`, `git pull`, or `git push` to the remote repository, you'll be asked for your GitHub username and password. {% data reusables.user_settings.password-authentication-deprecation %}

You can [use a credential helper](/github/using-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git) so Git will remember your GitHub username and personal access token every time it talks to GitHub.

### 문제 해결

You may encounter these errors when trying to change a remote.

#### No such remote '[name]'

This error means that the remote you tried to change doesn't exist:

```shell
$ git remote set-url sofake https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/octocat/Spoon-Knife
> fatal: No such remote 'sofake'
```

Check that you've correctly typed the remote name.
