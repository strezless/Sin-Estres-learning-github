You can filter files in a pull request by file extension type, such as `.html` or `.js`, lack of an extension, code ownership, or dotfiles.

{% tip %}

**Tip:** To simplify your pull request diff view, you can also temporarily hide deleted files or files you have already viewed in the pull request diff from the file filter drop-down menu.

{% endtip %}

{% data reusables.repositories.sidebar-pr %}
2. In the list of pull requests, click the pull request you'd like to filter.
{% data reusables.repositories.changed-files %}
4. Use the File filter drop-down menu, and select, unselect, or click the desired filters. ![File filter option above pull request diff](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/file-filter-option.png)
5. Optionally, to clear the filter selection, under the **Files changed** tab, click **Clear**. ![Clear file filter selection](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/clear-file-filter.png)
