Anyone with admin permissions to a repository can require a linear commit history.

### About enforcement of linear commit history

Enforcing a linear commit history prevents merge commits from being pushed to the protected branch. This means that any pull requests merged into the protected branch must use a squash merge or a rebase merge. A strictly linear commit history can help teams backtrack changes more efficiently. For more information about merge methods, see "[About pull request merges](/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges)."

Before you can require a linear commit history, your repository must allow squash merging or rebase merging. For more information, see "[Configuring pull request merges](/github/administering-a-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges)."
