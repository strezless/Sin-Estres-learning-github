{% note %}

**Note:** The deployments dashboard is currently in beta and subject to change.

{% endnote %}

People with read access to a repository can see an overview of all current deployments and a log of past deployment activity, if the repository's deployment workflow is integrated with {% data variables.product.product_name %} through the Deployments API or an app from [{% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}](https://github.com/marketplace/category/deployment). For more information, see "[Deployments](/v3/repos/deployments/)."

You can also see deployment information on the "Conversation" tab of a pull request.
