intro: 'If you''re a repository owner or have admin permissions in a repository, you can customize branch protections in the repository and enforce certain workflows, such as requiring more than one pull request review or requiring certain status checks to pass before allowing a pull request to merge.'

{% data reusables.repositories.branch-rules-example %}

You can also set up automatic branch protection for all branches in your repository with the wildcard syntax `*`. Because {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} uses the `File::FNM_PATHNAME` flag for the `File.fnmatch` syntax, the wildcard does not match directory separators (`/`). For example, `qa/*` will match all branches beginning with `qa/` and containing a single slash. You can include multiple slashes with `qa/**/*`, and you can extend the `qa` string with `qa**/**/*` to make it more inclusive. For more information about syntax options for branch rules, see the [fnmatch documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/File.html#method-c-fnmatch).

To create an exception to an existing branch rule, you can create a new branch protection rule that is higher priority, such as a branch rule for a specific branch name. For more information about the priority order and other settings for protected branch rules, see "[About protected branches](/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches)."

{% note %}

**Note:** To create a branch rule, the branch you specify doesn't have to exist yet in the repository.

6. Optionally, you can configure specific branch rule settings. ![Protected branch rule settings](/assets/images/help/branches/branch-rule-settings.png)
