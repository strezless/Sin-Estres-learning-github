For a "marked as duplicate" timeline event to appear, the user who creates the duplicate reference comment must have write access to the repository where they create the comment.

### Marking duplicates

To mark an issue or pull request as a duplicate, type "Duplicate of" followed by the issue or pull request number it duplicates in the body of a new comment. You can also use the GitHub-provided "Duplicate issue" or "Duplicate pull request" saved replies to mark an issue or pull request as a duplicate. For more information, see "[About saved replies](/articles/about-saved-replies)."

### Unmarking duplicates

You can unmark duplicate issues and pull requests by clicking **Undo** in the timeline. This will add a new timeline event, indicating that the issue or pull request was unmarked.
