The subscriptions list does not include every issue and pull request from repositories you're watching. You can manually subscribe to a specific issue or pull request to include it in your subscriptions list. For more information, see "[Subscribing to and unsubscribing from notifications](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/user/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/subscribing-to-and-unsubscribing-from-notifications)" and "[Watching and unwatching repositories](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/user/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/watching-and-unwatching-repositories)."

### Viewing a list of your subscriptions
