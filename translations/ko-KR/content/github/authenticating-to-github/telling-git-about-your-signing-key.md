### Telling Git about your GPG key

If you're using a GPG key that matches your committer identity and your verified email address associated with your {% data variables.product.product_name %} account, then you can begin signing commits and signing tags.

{% note %}

If you don't have a GPG key that matches your committer identity, you need to associate an email with an existing key. For more information, see "[Associating an email with your GPG key](/articles/associating-an-email-with-your-gpg-key)".

{% endnote %}

If you have multiple GPG keys, you need to tell Git which one to use.

{% data reusables.command_line.open_the_multi_os_terminal %}
{% data reusables.gpg.list-keys-with-note %}
{% data reusables.gpg.copy-gpg-key-id %}
{% data reusables.gpg.paste-gpg-key-id %}
1. If you aren't using the GPG suite, paste the text below to add the GPG key to your bash profile:
  ```shell
  $ test -r ~/.bash_profile && echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' >> ~/.bash_profile
  $ echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' >> ~/.profile
  ```
  {% note %}

  **Note:** If you don't have `.bash_profile`, this command adds your GPG key to `.profile`.

  {% endnote %}

{% endwindows %}

{% note %}

**Note:** X.509 keys are not supported on Linux. You can configure gpgsm to provide encryption and signing services, however, this is not currently supported by {% data variables.product.product_name %}. For more information, see the [gpgsm](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/Invoking-GPGSM.html) topic in the GnuPG documentation.
