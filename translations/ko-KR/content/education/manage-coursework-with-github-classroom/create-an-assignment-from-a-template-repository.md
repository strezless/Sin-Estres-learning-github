You can use a template repository on {% data variables.product.product_name %} as starter code for an assignment on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}. Your template repository can contain boilerplate code, documentation, and other resources for your students. For more information, see "[Creating a template repository](/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-template-repository)."

To use the template repository for your assignment, the template repository must be owned by your organization, or the visibility of the template repository must be public.
