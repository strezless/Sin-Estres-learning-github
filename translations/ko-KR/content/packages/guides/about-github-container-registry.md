| Hosting locations | You can host multiple packages in one repository.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | You can host multiple container images in one organization or user account.                                                                                                            |
| Permissions       | Each package inherits the permissions of the repository where the package is hosted. <br> <br> For example, anyone with read permissions for a repository can install a package as a dependency in a project, and anyone with write permissions can publish a new package version. | For each container image, you can choose the access level that others have. The permissions for container image access are separate from your organization and repository permissions. |
 Visibility | {% data reusables.package_registry.public-or-private-packages %} | You can set the visibility of each of your container images. A private container image is only visible to people and teams who are given access within your organization. A public container image is visible to anyone. | Anonymous access | N/A | You can access public container images anonymously.

#### Manifest Lists/Image Indexes

{% data variables.product.prodname_github_container_registry %} also supports [Docker Manifest List](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/#manifest-list)/[OCI Image Index](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/79b036d80240ae530a8de15e1d21c7ab9292c693/image-index.md) formats which are defined in the Docker V2, Schema 2 and OCI image specifications.

### Visibility and access permissions for container images

If you have admin permissions to a container image, you can set the container image to private or public. Public images allow anonymous access and can be pulled without authentication or signing in via the CLI.

As an admin, you can also grant access permissions for a container image that are separate from the permissions you've set at the organization and repository levels.

For container images published and owned by a user account, you can give any person an access role. For container images published and owned by an organization, you can give any person or team in the organization an access role.
