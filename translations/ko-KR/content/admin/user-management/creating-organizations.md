An organization is a collection of user accounts that owns repositories. Organizations have one or more owners, who have administrative privileges for the organization. Organizations can also be used for namespacingâ€”for example, `http(s)://[hostname]/[organization name]/` takes you to an organization's profile on {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %}, while `http(s)://[hostname]/[organization name]/[repository name]/` takes you to a repository's profile.

When you create an organization, it doesn't have any repositories associated with it. At any time, [members of the organization with the Owner role can add new repositories](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/user/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization), or transfer existing repositories. For more information, see "[Transferring a repository](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/user/articles/transferring-a-repository)".
