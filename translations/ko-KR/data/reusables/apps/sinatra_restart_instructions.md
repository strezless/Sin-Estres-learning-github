{% note %}

**Note:** You'll need to restart the Sinatra server before you can test changes. Enter `Ctrl-C` to stop the server, and then run `ruby template_server.rb` again. If you don't want to do this every time you change your app code, you can look into [reloading](http://sinatrarb.com/faq.html#reloading).
