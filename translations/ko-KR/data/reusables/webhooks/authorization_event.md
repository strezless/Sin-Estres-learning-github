Anyone can revoke their authorization of a GitHub App from their [GitHub account settings page](https://github.com/settings/apps/authorizations). Revoking the authorization of a GitHub App does not uninstall the GitHub App. You should program your GitHub App so that when it receives this webhook, it stops calling the API on behalf of the person who revoked the token. If your GitHub App continues to use a revoked access token, it will receive the `401 Bad Credentials` error.
