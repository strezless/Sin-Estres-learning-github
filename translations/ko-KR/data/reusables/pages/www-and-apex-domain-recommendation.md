If you are using an apex domain as your custom domain, we recommend also setting up a `www` subdomain. If you configure the correct records for each domain type through your DNS provider, {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} will automatically create redirects between the domains. For example, if you configure `www.example.com` as the custom domain for your site, and you have {% data variables.product.prodname_pages %} DNS records set up for the apex and `www` domains, then `example.com` will redirect to `www.example.com`. Note that automatic redirects only apply to the `www` subdomain. Automatic redirects do not apply to any other subdomains, such as `blog`.
