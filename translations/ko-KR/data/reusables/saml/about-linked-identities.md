You can view the single sign-on identity that a member has linked to their {% data variables.product.product_name %} account. When available, the entry will include SCIM data. For more information, see "[About SCIM](/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/about-scim)."

If a member links the wrong identity to their {% data variables.product.product_name %} account, you can revoke the linked identity to allow the member to try again.
