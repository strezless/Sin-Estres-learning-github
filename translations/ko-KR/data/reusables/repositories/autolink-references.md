If custom autolink references are configured for a repository, then references to external resources, like a JIRA issue or Zendesk ticket, convert into shortened links. To know which autolinks are available in your repository, contact someone with admin permissions to the repository. For more information, see "[Configuring autolinks to reference external resources](/articles/configuring-autolinks-to-reference-external-resources)."
