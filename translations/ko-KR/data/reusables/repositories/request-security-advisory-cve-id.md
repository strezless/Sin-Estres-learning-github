If you don't already have a CVE identification number for the security vulnerability in your project, you can request a CVE identification number from {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} usually reviews the request within 72 hours. Requesting a CVE identification number doesn't make your security advisory public. If your security advisory is eligible for a CVE,  {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} will reserve a CVE identification number for your advisory. We'll then publish the CVE details after you publish the security advisory.
