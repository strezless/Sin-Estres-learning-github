The pull request will upgrade the dependency to the minimum possible secure version needed to avoid the vulnerability.

{% note %}

**Note:** It's good practice to have automated tests and acceptance processes in place so that checks are carried out before the pull request is merged. This is particularly important if the suggested version to upgrade to contains additional functionality, or a change that breaks your project's code.
