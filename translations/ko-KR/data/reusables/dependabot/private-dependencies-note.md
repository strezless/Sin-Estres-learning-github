When running security or version updates, some ecosystems must be able to resolve all dependencies from their source to verify that updates have been successful. If your manifest or lock files contain any private dependencies, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} must be able to access the location at which those dependencies are hosted. Organization owners can grant {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} access to private repositories containing dependencies for a project within the same organization. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization#allowing-dependabot-to-access-private-dependencies)." You can configure access to private registries in a repository's _dependabot.yml_ configuration file. For more information, see "[Configuration options for dependency updates](/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#configuration-options-for-private-registries)."
