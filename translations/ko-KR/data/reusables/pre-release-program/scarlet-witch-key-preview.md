**Note:** Developers can preview a new `code_of_conduct` key in responses. For more information, see [Codes of Conduct API](/v3/codes_of_conduct/).

To access this new response key during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](/v3/media) in the `Accept` header:
```
application/vnd.github.scarlet-witch-preview+json
```
{% endnote %}
