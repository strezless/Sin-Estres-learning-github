**Note:** Enabling and disabling Pages in the Pages API is currently available for developers to preview. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-03-14-enabling-disabling-pages/) preview for more details. To access the new endpoints during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](/v3/media) in the `Accept` header:
```
application/vnd.github.switcheroo-preview+json
```
