**Note:** The [reactions API](/v3/reactions/) is available for developers to preview. The `url` can be used to construct the API location for [listing and creating](/v3/reactions) reactions. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-05-12-reactions-api-preview) for full details. To receive the `reactions` object in the response for this endpoint you must provide a custom [media type](/v3/media) in the `Accept` header:

```
application/vnd.github.squirrel-girl-preview
```

{% endnote %}
