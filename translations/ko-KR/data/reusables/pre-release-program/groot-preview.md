**Note:** Listing branches or pull requests for a commit in the Commits API is currently available for developers to preview. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-04-11-pulls-branches-for-commit/) for more details. To access the new endpoints during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](/v3/media) in the `Accept` header:
```
application/vnd.github.groot-preview+json
```
