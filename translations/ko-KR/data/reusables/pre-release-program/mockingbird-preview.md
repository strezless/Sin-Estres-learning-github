**Note:** The API to get issue timeline events is currently available for developers to preview. During the preview period, the APIs may change without advance notice. Please see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-05-23-timeline-preview-api/) for full details. To access the API you must provide a custom [media type](/v3/media) in the `Accept` header:

```
application/vnd.github.mockingbird-preview
```
