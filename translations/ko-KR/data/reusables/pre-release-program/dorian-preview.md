**Note:** Enabling and disabling dependency alerts for a repository using the REST API is currently available for developers to preview. To access these new endpoints during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](/v3/media) in the `Accept` header:
```
application/vnd.github.dorian-preview+json
```
