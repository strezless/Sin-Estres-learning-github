By default, your account will have a spending limit of $0, which prevents additional usage of minutes or storage after you reach these limits. If you increase your spending limit above the default of $0, you will be billed for any minutes or storage beyond the limits, also called overages. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} charges usage to the account that owns the repository where the workflow is run. Any coupons on your account do not apply to {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} overages.
