When you use the repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN` to perform tasks on behalf of the {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} app, events triggered by the `GITHUB_TOKEN` will not create a new workflow run. This prevents you from accidentally creating recursive workflow runs. For example, if a workflow run pushes code using the repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN`, a new workflow will not run even when the repository contains a workflow configured to run when `push` events occur.
