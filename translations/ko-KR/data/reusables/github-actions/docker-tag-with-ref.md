The above workflow checks out the {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repository, and uses the `build-push-action` action to build and push the Docker image. It sets the `build-push-action` option [`tag_with_ref`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images#tag_with_ref) to automatically tag the built Docker image with the Git reference of the workflow event. This workflow is triggered on publishing a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} release, so the reference will be the Git tag for the release.
