Once you have a token, you can enter it instead of your password when performing Git operations over HTTPS.

For example, on the command line you would enter the following:

```shell
$ git clone https://{% data variables.command_line.codeblock %}/<em>username</em>/<em>repo</em>.git
Username: <code>your_username</code>
Password: <em>your_token</em>
```
