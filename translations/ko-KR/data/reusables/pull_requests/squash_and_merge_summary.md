When you select the **Squash and merge** option on a pull request on {% data variables.product.product_location %}, the pull request's commits are squashed into a single commit. Instead of seeing all of a contributor's individual commits from a topic branch, the commits are combined into one commit and merged into the default branch. Pull requests with squashed commits are merged using the [fast-forward option](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_fast_forward_merge).

To squash and merge pull requests, you must have [write permissions](/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/) in the repository, and the repository must [allow squash merging](/articles/configuring-commit-squashing-for-pull-requests/).

You can use squash and merge to create a more streamlined Git history in your repository. Work-in-progress commits are helpful when working on a feature branch, but they arenâ€™t necessarily important to retain in the Git history. If you squash these commits into one commit while merging to the default branch, you can retain the original changes with a clear Git history.
