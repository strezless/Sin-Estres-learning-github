If you delete a head branch after its pull request has been merged, {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} checks for any open pull requests in the same repository that specify the deleted branch as their base branch. {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} automatically updates any such pull requests, changing their base branch to the merged pull request's base branch.
