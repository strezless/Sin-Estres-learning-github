### About discussions

With {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %}, the community for your project can create and participate in conversations within the project's repository. Discussions empower a project's maintainers, contributors, and visitors to gather and accomplish the following goals in a central location, without third-party tools.

- Share announcements and information, gather feedback, plan, and make decisions
- Ask questions, discuss and answer the questions, and mark the discussions as answered
- Foster an inviting atmosphere for visitors and contributors to discuss goals, development, administration, and workflows

You don't need to close a discussion like you close an issue or a pull request.

If a repository administrator or project maintainer enables discussions for a repository, anyone who visits the repository can create and participate in discussions for the repository. Repository administrators and project maintainers can manage discussions and discussion categories in a repository, and pin discussions to increase the visibility of the discussion. Moderators and collaborators can mark comments as answers, lock discussions, and convert issues to discussions.
