### For GitHub Apps

Apps with the {% octicon "verified" aria-label="The verified badge" %}, are owned by an organization that has:
- Confirmed their domain
- Confirmed their email address so {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} Support can reach the organization
- Required two-factor authentication for their organization. Weitere Informationen finden Sie unter „[Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung in Ihrer Organisation erzwingen](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization)“.

For more information about the requirements for listing an app on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, see "[Requirements for listing an app on {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}](/marketplace/getting-started/requirements-for-listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/)."

### For GitHub actions

Actions with the {% octicon "verified" aria-label="The verified badge" %}, or  verified creator  badge,  indicate that {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} has verified the creator of the action as a partner organization.

For information on how to publish a GitHub action to {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %}, see "[Publishing actions in GitHub Marketplace](/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace)."

### About the previous verification process for apps

In addition to the verified creator badge, you'll also see badges for unverified and verified apps. These apps were published using the old method for verifying individual apps.

{% note %}

**Note:** The new publisher verification process for apps replaces the previous process where individual apps were verified. The new publisher verification process is similar to the verification process for actions. If you have apps that were verified under the old process, these will not be affected by the changes. The {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} team will contact you with details of how to migrate to organization-based verification.
