### About {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} with {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}

{% data reusables.repositories.about-github-actions %} {% data reusables.repositories.actions-ci-cd %} For more information, see "[About {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}](/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-github-actions)."

You can extend the CI and CD capabilities of your repository by publishing or installing packages as part of your workflow.

#### Authenticating to {% data variables.product.prodname_github_container_registry %}

{% data reusables.package_registry.container-registry-beta %}

{% data reusables.package_registry.authenticate_with_pat_for_container_registry %}

For an authentication example, see "[Authenticating with the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %}](/packages/getting-started-with-github-container-registry/migrating-to-github-container-registry-for-docker-images#authenticating-with-the-container-registry)."

{% endif %}

#### Authenticating to package registries on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}

{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" %}If you want your workflow to authenticate to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} to access a package registry other than the {% data variables.product.prodname_container_registry %} on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, then{% else %}To authenticate to package registries on {% data variables.product.product_name %},{% endif %} we recommend using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` that {% data variables.product.product_name %} automatically creates for your repository when you enable {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} instead of a personal access token for authentication. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` has `read:packages` and `write:packages` scopes to the current repository. For forks, the token also has the `read:packages` scope for the parent repository.

You can reference the `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your workflow file using the {% raw %}`{{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}`{% endraw %} context. For more information, see "[Authenticating with the GITHUB_TOKEN](/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/authenticating-with-the-github_token)."

### Publishing a package using an action

You can use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to automatically publish packages as part of your continuous integration (CI) flow. This approach to continuous deployment (CD) allows you to automate the creation of new package versions, if the code meets your quality standards. For example, you could create a workflow that runs CI tests every time a developer pushes code to a particular branch. If the tests pass, the workflow can publish a new package version to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}.

{% data reusables.package_registry.actions-configuration %}

The following example demonstrates how you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} to build and test your app, and then automatically create a Docker image and publish it to {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}:

- Create a new workflow file in your repository (such as `.github/workflows/deploy-image.yml`), and add the following YAML:
  {% raw %}
  ```
  name: Create and publish a package
  on:
    push:
      branches: ['release']
  jobs:
    run-npm-build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: npm install and build webpack
          run: |
            npm install
            npm run build
        - uses: actions/upload-artifact@main
          with:
            name: webpack artifacts
            path: public/

    run-npm-test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      needs: run-npm-build
      strategy:
        matrix:
          os: [ubuntu-latest]
          node-version: [12.x, 14.x]
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          uses: actions/setup-node@v1
          with:
            node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        - uses: actions/download-artifact@main
          with:
            name: webpack artifacts
            path: public
        - name: npm install, and test
          run: |
            npm install
            npm test
          env:
            CI: true

    build-and-push-image:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      needs: run-npm-test
      steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build container image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          registry: docker.pkg.github.com
          repository: ${{ github.repository }}/octo-image
          tag_with_sha: true
          tag_with_ref: true
  ```

- This new workflow will run automatically every time you push a change to the repository. You can view the progress in the **Actions** tab.
- A few minutes after the workflow has completed, the new package will visible in your repository. To find your available packages, see "[Viewing a repository's packages](/packages/publishing-and-managing-packages/viewing-packages#viewing-a-repositorys-packages)."

### Installing a package using an action

You can install packages as part of your CI flow using {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}. For example, you could configure a workflow so that anytime a developer pushes code to a pull request, the workflow resolves dependencies by downloading and installing packages hosted by {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}. Then, the workflow can run CI tests that require the dependencies.

Installing packages hosted by {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} through {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} requires minimal configuration or additional authentication when you use `GITHUB_TOKEN`.{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" %} Data transfer is also free when an action installs a package. For more information, see "[About billing for {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %}](/github/setting-up-and-managing-billing-and-payments-on-github/about-billing-for-github-packages)."{% endif %}

{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" %}
`GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot install packages from any private repository besides the repository where the action runs.  You cannot currently use `GITHUB_TOKEN` to authenticate to {% data variables.product.prodname_github_container_registry %}.
{% endif %}
