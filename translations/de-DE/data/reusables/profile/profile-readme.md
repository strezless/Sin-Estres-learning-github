If you add a README file to the root of a public repository with the same name as your username, that README will automatically appear on your profile page. You can edit your profile README with {% data variables.product.company_short %} Flavored Markdown to create a personalized section on your profile. For more information, see "[Managing your profile README](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)."
