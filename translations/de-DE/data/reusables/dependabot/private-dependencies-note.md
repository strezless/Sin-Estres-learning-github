When running security or version updates, some ecosystems must be able to resolve all dependencies from their source to verify that updates have been successful. If your manifest or lock files contain any private dependencies, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} must be able to access the location at which those dependencies are hosted. Organization owners can grant {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} access to private repositories containing dependencies for a project within the same organization. For more information, see "[Managing security and analysis settings for your organization](/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-organization#allowing-dependabot-to-access-private-repositories)."

Currently, {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} version updates doesn't support manifest or lock files that contain any dependencies hosted in private registries, or in private {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} repositories that belong to a different organization than the dependent project.
