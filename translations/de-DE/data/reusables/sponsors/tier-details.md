Du kannst bis zu zehn Sponsoringstufen für Sponsoren einrichten. Each tier has its own monthly or one-time payment amount in US dollars and benefits, such as receiving early access to new versions or being featured in the project's README. In addition, you can choose to enable tiers for custom amounts (monthly and one-time).

Once you have published a tier, you can't edit the price of that tier. Stattdessen musst Du die Stufe zurückziehen und einen neue Stufe erstellen. Existing sponsors will remain on the retired tier until they change their sponsorship tier, cancel their sponsorship, or their one-time sponsorship period expires.
