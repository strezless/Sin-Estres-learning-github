You can optionally configure an assignment to use an online integrated development environment (IDE). Online IDEs allow your students to write code, run programs, and collaborate in a browser, without installing Git and a full development toolchain on the student's computer. If you choose an online IDE for an assignment, students can still check out and run code locally on a computer with the necessary software.
