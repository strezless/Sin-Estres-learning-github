By default, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} enables an invitation URL for each assignment you create. Students can accept and submit the assignment while the invitation URL is enabled. You can share the URL with your students on your LMS, course homepage, or wherever you post assignments. Students can also navigate to the assignment on {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} if the student has already accepted an assignment for the classroom.
