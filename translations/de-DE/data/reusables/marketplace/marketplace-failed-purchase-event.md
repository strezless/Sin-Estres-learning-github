In the case where a customer upgrades their plan and the payment fails, GitHub reverts their {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} subscription to its previous state. GitHub also send an email to the customer to inform them of the failure and allow them to re-attempt their purchase. You will receive a webhook with the `changed` action requesting you to revert to the previous plan.
