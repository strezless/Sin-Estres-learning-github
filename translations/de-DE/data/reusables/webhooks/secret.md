Setting a webhook secret allows you to ensure that `POST` requests sent to the payload URL are from {% data variables.product.product_name %}. When you set a secret, you'll receive the {% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" or currentVersion ver_gt "enterprise-server@2.22" %}`X-Hub-Signature` and `X-Hub-Signature-256` headers{% elsif currentVersion ver_lt "enterprise-server@2.23" %}`X-Hub-Signature` header{% elsif currentVersion == "github-ae@latest" %}`X-Hub-Signature-256` header{% endif %} in the webhook `POST` request. For more information on how to use a secret with a signature header to secure your webhook payloads, see "[Securing your webhooks](/webhooks/securing/)."
