# Glossaries

The following files comprise our [Crowdin Glossary](https://support.crowdin.com/glossary/):

* `external.yml` contains customer-facing glossary entries.
* `internal.yml` contains entries used by translators only. These terms are displayed in the Crowdin UI to give translators additional context about what they're translating, plus a suggested localized string for that term.
* `candidates.yml` contains terms that should potentially be in either the internal or external glossary but haven't been defined yet.
