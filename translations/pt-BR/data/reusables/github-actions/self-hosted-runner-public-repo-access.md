**Note:** For security reasons, public repositories can't use runners in a runner group by default, but you can override this in the runner group's settings. Para obter mais informações, consulte "[Gerenciando acesso a runners auto-hospedados usando grupos](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups#changing-the-access-policy-of-a-self-hosted-runner-group)".
