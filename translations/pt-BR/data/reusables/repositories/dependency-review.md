Additionally,
{% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} can review any dependencies added, updated, or removed in a pull request made against the default branch of a repository, and flag any changes that would introduce a vulnerability into your project. This allows you to spot and deal with vulnerable dependencies before, rather than after, they reach your codebase.
