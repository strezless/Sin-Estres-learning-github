      notes:
        - |
          [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a powerful, flexible solution for CI/CD and workflow automation. GitHub Actions on Enteprise Server includes tools to help you manage the service, including key metrics in the Management Console, audit logs and access controls to help you control the roll out.

          You will need to provide your own [storage](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-and-configuring-storage) and runners for GitHub Actions. AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage and MinIO are supported. Please review the [updated minimum requirements for your platform](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance) before you turn on GitHub Actions. To learn more, contact the GitHub Sales team or [sign up for the beta](https://resources.github.com/beta-signup/). {% comment %} https://github.com/github/releases/issues/775 {% endcomment %}

      heading: GitHub Packages Beta
      notes:
        - |
          [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/features/packages) is a package hosting service, natively integrated with GitHub APIs, Actions, and webhooks. Create an [end-to-end DevOps workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/admin/packages/configuring-packages-support-for-your-enterprise) that includes your code, continuous integration, and deployment solutions.

          Supported storage back ends include AWS S3 and MinIO with support for Azure blob coming in a future release. Please note that the current Docker support will be replaced by a beta of the new GitHub Container Registry in the next release. Please review the [updated minimum requirements for your platform](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/admin/installation/setting-up-a-github-enterprise-server-instance) before you turn on GitHub Packages.

          When a [pull request's head branch](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/user/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches#working-with-branches) is merged and deleted, all other open pull requests in the same repository that target this branch are now retargeted to the merged pull request's base branch. Previously these pull requests were closed. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/releases/issues/801 {% endcomment %}

      heading: Suspend and Unsuspend an App Installation
      notes:
        - |
          Administrators and users can [suspend any GitHub App’s access](https://docs.github.com/enterprise/2.22/user/rest/reference/apps#suspend-an-app-installation) for as long as needed, and [unsuspend the app](https://docs.github.com/enterprise/2.22/user/rest/reference/apps#unsuspend-an-app-installation) on command through Settings and the API. Suspended apps cannot access the GitHub API or webhook events. You can use this instead of uninstalling an application, which deauthorises every user. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/github/pull/138316 https://github.com/github/github/pull/150869 {% endcomment %}''

      heading: Improved Large Scale Performance
      notes:
        - |
          We have revised the approach we take to scheduling network maintenance for repositories, ensuring large monorepos are able to avoid failure states. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/github/pull/146789, https://github.com/github/github/pull/147931, https://github.com/github/github/pull/146724, https://github.com/github/git-protocols/issues/94 {% endcomment %}''

          Passive replicas are now [supported and configurable on GitHub Enterprise Server cluster deployments](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/admin/enterprise-management/configuring-high-availability-replication-for-a-cluster). These changes will enable faster failover, reducing RTO and RPO. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/releases/issues/905 {% endcomment %}

      heading: View All of Your Users
      notes:
        - |
          For exceptionally large teams, administrators can [adjust the 1,500 default maximum for user lists](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/admin/configuration/command-line-utilities#ghe-config). {% comment %} https://github.com/github/github/pull/146508 {% endcomment %}''
  changes:
    - 
      heading: Administration Changes

        - 'It''s now possible to [manage global announcements and expiration dates through the enterprise account settings](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/admin/installation/command-line-utilities#ghe-announce). {% comment %} https://github.com/github/releases/issues/945, https://github.com/github/github/pull/148475, https://github.com/github/github/pull/148494 {% endcomment %}'
        - You can now [exempt certain users from the default API rate limits configured in the management console](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/admin/configuration/configuring-rate-limits), if necessary. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/github/pull/148673 {% endcomment %}
        - Repository administrators can now [set their repository to any available visibility option](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/user/github/administering-a-repository/setting-repository-visibility) from a single dialog in the repository's settings. Previously, you had to navigate separate sections, buttons, and dialog boxes for changing between public and private and between private and internal. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/releases/issues/882 {% endcomment %}
        - A new Enterprise settings link on the user dropdown menu makes it easier to navigate to Enterprise Account Settings. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/releases/issues/946, https://github.com/github/github/pull/150595, https://github.com/github/github/pull/150520, https://github.com/github/github/pull/151121, https://github.com/github/hydro-schemas/pull/1244 {% endcomment %}

        - '[Accessing resources by using a personal access token or SSH key now counts as user activity](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/admin/user-management/managing-dormant-users). This relieves administrators from the burden of filtering out certain users from the user dormancy reports and makes it safer to use the "Suspend all" button without accidentally suspending users who only accessed GitHub in a read-only way over the APIs with a Personal Access Token (PAT) or SSH key. {% comment %} https://github.com/github/github/pull/140433, https://github.com/github/help-docs/pull/14853, https://github.com/github/customer-feedback/issues/174, https://github.com/github/supportability/issues/14 {% endcomment %}'

      heading: Deprecation of Legacy GitHub App Webhook Events
      notes:
        - 'Starting with GitHub Enterprise Server 2.21.0 two legacy GitHub Apps-related webhook events have been deprecated and will be removed in GitHub Enterprise Server 2.25.0. The deprecated events `integration_installation` and `integration_installation_repositories` have equivalent events which will be supported. More information is available in the [deprecation announcement blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-04-15-replacing-the-installation-and-installation-repositories-events/). {% comment %} https://github.com/github/enterprise-web/pull/6419#issuecomment-668303461 {% endcomment %}'

      heading: Deprecation of Legacy GitHub Apps Endpoint
      notes:
        - 'Starting with GitHub Enterprise Server 2.21.0 the legacy GitHub Apps endpoint for creating installation access tokens was deprecated and will be removed in GitHub Enterprise Server 2.25.0.

    - 
      heading: Deprecation of OAuth Application API
      notes:
        - GitHub no longer supports the OAuth application endpoints that contain `access_token` as a path parameter.

While deprecated, the endpoints are still accessible in this version. We intend to remove these endpoints on GitHub Enterprise Server 3.4. For more information, see the [deprecation announcement blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-app-endpoint/).
