    - "**HIGH:** An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise Server that allowed access tokens generated from a GitHub App's [web authentication flow](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps#web-application-flow) to read private repository metadata via the REST API without having been granted the appropriate permissions. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize the application through the web authentication flow. The private repository metadata returned would be limited to repositories owned by the user the token identifies. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.0.4 and was fixed in versions 3.0.4, 2.22.10, 2.21.18. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2021-22865 and was reported via the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com)."
    - Os pacotes foram atualizados para as últimas versões de segurança.
  bugs:
    - When maintenance mode was enabled, some services continued to be listed as "active processes" even though they were expected to be running, and should not have been listed.
    - After upgrading from 2.22.x to 3.0.x with GitHub Actions enabled, the self-hosted runner version was not updated and no self-hosted updates were made.
    - Old GitHub Pages builds were not cleaned up leading to increased disk usage.
    - '`memcached` was not running on active replicas.'
    - Upgrade failed when updating file permissions when GitHub Actions was enabled.
    - A timezone set on GitHub Enterprise 11.10.x or earlier was not being used by some services which were defaulting to UTC time.
    - Services were not transitioning to new log files as part of log rotation, resulting in increased disk usage.
    - The `ghe-saml-mapping-csv` command-line utility produced a warning message.
    - The label on search results for internal repositories was shown as "Private" instead of "Internal".
  known_issues:
    - On a freshly set up GitHub Enterprise Server without any users, an attacker could create the first admin user.
    - As regras personalizadas de firewall não são mantidas durante uma atualização.
    - Arquivos LFS do Git [enviados através da interface web](https://github.com/blog/2105-upload-files-to-your-repositories) são adicionados diretamente ao repositório e de forma incorreta.
    - Issues cannot be closed if they contain a permalink to a blob in the same repository where the file path is longer than 255 characters.
    - Quando "Usuários podem pesquisar pelo GitHub.com" está habilitado com o GitHub Connect, os problemas em repositórios privados e internos não estão incluídos nos resultados de pesquisa do GitHub.com.
    - Jupyter Notebook rendering in the web UI may fail if the notebook includes non-ASCII UTF-8 characters.
    - reStructuredText (RST) rendering in the web UI may fail and instead display raw RST markup text.
