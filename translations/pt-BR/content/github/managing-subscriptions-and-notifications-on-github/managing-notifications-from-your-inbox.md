### About your inbox

{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" %}
{% data reusables.notifications-v2.notifications-inbox-required-setting %} For more information, see "[Configuring notifications](/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/configuring-notifications#choosing-your-notification-settings)."
{% endif %}

To access your notifications inbox, in the upper-right corner of any page, click {% octicon "bell" aria-label="The notifications bell" %}.

  ![Notification indicating any unread message](/assets/images/help/notifications/notifications_general_existence_indicator.png)

Your inbox shows all of the notifications that you haven't unsubscribed to or marked as **Done.** You can customize your inbox to best suit your workflow using filters, viewing all or just unread notifications, and grouping your notifications to get a quick overview.

  ![inbox view](/assets/images/help/notifications-v2/inbox-view.png)

By default, your inbox will show read and unread notifications. To only see unread notifications, click **Unread** or use the `is:unread` query.

### Triaging options

You have several options for triaging notifications from your inbox.

| Triaging option | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Save            | Saves your notification for later review. To save a notification, to the right of the notification, click {% octicon "bookmark" aria-label="The bookmark icon" %}. <br> <br> Saved notifications are kept indefinitely and can be viewed by clicking **Saved** in the sidebar or with the `is:saved` query. If your saved notification is older than 5 months and becomes unsaved, the notification will disappear from your inbox within a day. |
| Done            | Marks a notification as completed and removes the notification from your inbox. You can see all completed notifications by clicking **Done** in the sidebar or with the `is:done` query. Notifications marked as **Done** are saved for 5 months.
| Unsubscribe     | Automatically removes the notification from your inbox and unsubscribes you from the conversation until you are @mentioned, a team you're on is @mentioned, or you're requested for review.
| Read            | Marks a notification as read. To only view read notifications in your inbox, use the `is:read` query. This query doesn't include notifications marked as **Done**.
| Unread          | Marks notification as unread. To only view unread notifications in your inbox, use the `is:unread` query. |

To see the available keyboard shortcuts, see "[Keyboard Shortcuts](/github/getting-started-with-github/keyboard-shortcuts#notifications)."

Before choosing a triage option, you can preview your notification's details first and investigate. For more information, see "[Triaging a single notification](/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/triaging-a-single-notification)."

### Triaging multiple notifications at the same time

To triage multiple notifications at once, select the relevant notifications and use the {% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="The edit icon" %} drop-down to choose a triage option.

### Default notification filters

By default, your inbox has filters for when you are assigned, participating in a thread, requested to review a pull request, or when your username is @mentioned directly or a team you're a member of is @mentioned.

  ![Default custom filters](/assets/images/help/notifications-v2/default-filters.png)

### Customizing your inbox with custom filters

You can add up to 15 of your own custom filters.

{% data reusables.notifications.access_notifications %}
2. To open the filter settings, in the left sidebar, next to "Filters", click {% octicon "gear" aria-label="The Gear icon" %}.

  {% tip %}

  **Tip:** You can quickly preview a filter's inbox results by creating a query in your inbox view and clicking **Save**, which opens the custom filter settings.

  {% endtip %}

3. Add a name for your filter and a filter query. For example, to only see notifications for a specific repository, you can create a filter using the query `repo:octocat/open-source-project-name reason:participating`. You can also add emojis with a native emoji keyboard. For a list of supported search queries, see "[Supported queries for custom filters](#supported-queries-for-custom-filters)."

  ![Custom filter example](/assets/images/help/notifications-v2/custom-filter-example.png)

4. Click **Create**.

### Custom filter limitations

Custom filters do not currently support:
  - Full text search in your inbox, including searching for pull request or issue titles.
  - Distinguishing between the `is:issue`, `is:pr`, and `is:pull-request` query filters. These queries will return both issues and pull requests.
  - Creating more than 15 custom filters.
  - Changing the default filters or their order.
  - Search [exclusion](/github/searching-for-information-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#exclude-certain-results) using `NOT` or `-QUALIFIER`.

### Supported queries for custom filters

There are three types of filters that you can use:
  - Filter by repository with `repo:`
  - Filter by discussion type with `is:`
  - Filter by notification reason with `reason:`

To add a `repo:` filter, you must include the owner of the repository in the query. For example, `repo:atom/atom` represents the Atom repository owned by the Atom organization.

#### Supported `reason:` queries

To filter notifications by why you've received an update, you can use the `reason:` query. For example, to see notifications when you (or a team you're on) is requested to review a pull request, use `reason:review-requested`. For more information, see "[About notifications](/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications#reasons-for-receiving-notifications)."

| Query | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `reason:assign` | When there's an update on an issue or pull request you've been assigned to.
| `reason:author` | When you opened a pull request or issue and there has been an update or new comment.
| `reason:comment`| When you commented on an issue, pull request, or team discussion.
| `reason:participating` | When you have commented on an issue, pull request, or team discussion or you have been @mentioned.
| `reason:invitation` | When you're invited to a team, organization, or repository.
| `reason:manual` | When you click **Subscribe** on an issue or pull request you weren't already subscribed to.
| `reason:mention` | You were directly @mentioned.
| `reason:review-requested` | You or a team you're on have been requested to review a pull request.{% if currentVersion != "github-ae@latest" %}
| `reason:security-alert` | When a security alert is issued for a repository.{% endif %}
| `reason:state-change`  | When the state of a pull request or issue is changed. For example, an issue is closed or a pull request is merged.
| `reason:team-mention` | When a team you're a member of is @mentioned.
| `reason:ci-activity` | When a repository has a CI update, such as a new workflow run status.

#### Supported `is:` queries

To filter notifications for specific activity on {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you can use the  `is` query. For example, to only see repository invitation updates, use `is:repository-invitation`{% if currentVersion != "github-ae@latest" %}, and to only see {% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" or currentVersion ver_gt "enterprise-server@2.21" %}{% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %}{% else %} security{% endif %} alerts, use `is:repository-vulnerability-alert`.{% endif %}

- `is:check-suite`
- `is:commit`
- `is:gist`
- `is:issue-or-pull-request`
- `is:release`
- `is:repository-invitation`{% if currentVersion != "github-ae@latest" %}
- `is:repository-vulnerability-alert`
- `is:repository-advisory`{% endif %}
- `is:team-discussion`{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" %}
- `is:discussions`{% endif %}

{% if currentVersion != "github-ae@latest" %}
For information about reducing noise from notifications for {% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" or currentVersion ver_gt "enterprise-server@2.21" %}{% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot_alerts %}{% else %}security alerts{% endif %}, see "[Configuring notifications for vulnerable dependencies](/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/configuring-notifications-for-vulnerable-dependencies)."
{% endif %}

You can also use the `is:` query to describe how the notification was triaged.

- `is:saved`
- `is:done`
- `is:unread`
- `is:read`
