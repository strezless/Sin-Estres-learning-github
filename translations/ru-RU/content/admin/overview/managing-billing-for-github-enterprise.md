### About billing for enterprise accounts

Enterprise accounts are currently available to {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %} customers paying by invoice. Billing for all of the organizations and {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} instances connected to your enterprise account is aggregated into a single bill charge for all of your paid {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %} services (including paid licenses in organizations, {% data variables.large_files.product_name_long %} data packs, and subscriptions for {% data variables.product.prodname_marketplace %} apps).

Enterprise owners and billing managers can access and manage all billing settings for enterprise accounts. For more information about enterprise accounts, see "[Roles of an enterprise account](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise-account/roles-for-an-enterprise-account)." For more information about managing billing managers, see "[Inviting people to manage your enterprise account](/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise-account/inviting-people-to-manage-your-enterprise-account)."
