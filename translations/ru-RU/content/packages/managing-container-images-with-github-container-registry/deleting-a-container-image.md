### About package deletion

You can remove an entire container image or a specific version on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. To delete a container image, you must use the UI. Using GraphQL to delete a container image is not supported at this time.

To delete a container image, you must have admin permissions to the container image.

When deleting public packages, be aware that you may break projects that depend on your package.
