title: About email notifications
intro: 'When you enable email notifications, you will receive participating and watching notifications in your email client, and you can filter them using the email header information.'
versions:
  enterprise-server: <2.21

For more information about the differences between *participating* and *watching* notifications, see "[About notifications](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/user/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/about-notifications)."

After enabling email notifications, {% data variables.product.product_name %} will send notifications to you as multipart emails that contain both HTML and plain text copies of the content. Email notification content includes any Markdown, @mentions, emojis, hash-links, and more, that appear in the original content on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. If you only want to see the text in the email, you can configure your email client to display the plain text copy only. For more information about enabling email notifications, see "[Choosing the delivery method for your notifications](/enterprise/{{ currentVersion }}/user/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/choosing-the-delivery-method-for-your-notifications)."

### Filtering email notifications

Each email notification that {% data variables.product.product_name %} sends contains header information. The header information in every email is consistent, so you can use it in your email client to filter or forward all {% data variables.product.product_name %} notifications, or certain types of {% data variables.product.product_name %} notifications.

Email notifications from {% data variables.product.product_name %} contain the following header information:

| Header                                                    | Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
