If you publicize your private contributions, people without access to the private repositories you work in won't be able to see the details of your private contributions. Instead, they'll see the number of private contributions you made on any given day. Your public contributions will include detailed information. For more information, see "[Viewing contributions on your profile page](/articles/viewing-contributions-on-your-profile-page)".

### Changing the visibility of your private contributions

By default, visitors only see public contributions on your profile.

{% data reusables.profile.access_profile %}
2. Publicize or hide your private contributions on your profile:
    - To publicize your private contributions, above your contributions graph, use the **Contribution settings** drop-down menu, and select **Private contributions**. Visitors will see your private contribution counts without further details. ![Enable visitors to see private contributions from contribution settings drop-down menu](/assets/images/help/profile/private-contributions-on.png)
    - To hide your private contributions, above your contributions graph, use the **Contribution settings** drop-down menu, and unselect **Private contributions.** Visitors will only see your public contributions. ![Enable visitors to see private contributions from contribution settings drop-down menu](/assets/images/help/profile/private-contributions-off.png)
