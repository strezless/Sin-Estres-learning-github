### About file{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" or currentVersion ver_gt "enterprise-server@3.0" %} and directory{% endif %} deletion

You can delete an individual file in your repository{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" or currentVersion ver_gt "enterprise-server@3.0" %} or an entire directory, including all the files in the directory{% endif %}.

If you try to delete a file{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" or currentVersion ver_gt "enterprise-server@3.0" %} or directory{% endif %} in a repository that you donâ€™t have write permissions to, we'll fork the project to your user account and help you send a pull request to the original repository after you commit your change. For more information, see "[About pull requests](/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)."

If the file{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" or currentVersion ver_gt "enterprise-server@3.0" %} or directory{% endif %} you deleted contains sensitive data, the data will still be available in the repository's Git history. To completely remove the file from {% data variables.product.product_name %}, you must remove the file from your repository's history. For more information, see "[Removing sensitive data from a repository](/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository)."
