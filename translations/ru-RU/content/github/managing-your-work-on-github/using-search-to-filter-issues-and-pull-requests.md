The issues and pull requests search bar allows you to define your own custom filters and sort by a wide variety of criteria. You can find the search bar on each repository's **Issues** and **Pull requests** tabs and on your [Issues and Pull requests dashboards](/articles/viewing-all-of-your-issues-and-pull-requests).

With issue and pull request search terms, you can:

- Filter issues and pull requests by author: `state:open type:issue author:octocat`
- Filter issues and pull requests that involve, but don't necessarily [**@mention**](/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-people-and-teams), certain people: `state:open type:issue involves:octocat`
- Filter issues and pull requests by assignee: `state:open type:issue assignee:octocat`
- Filter issues and pull requests by label: `state:open type:issue label:"bug"`
- Filter out search terms by using `-` before the term: `state:open type:issue -author:octocat`

{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" or currentVersion ver_gt "enterprise-server@2.20" or currentVersion == "github-ae@latest" %}
For issues, you can also use search to:

- Filter for issues that are linked to a pull request by a closing reference: `linked:pr`
{% endif %}

For pull requests, you can also use search to:
- Filter [draft](/articles/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) pull requests: `is:draft`
- Filter pull requests that haven't been [reviewed](/articles/about-pull-request-reviews) yet: `state:open type:pr review:none`
- Filter pull requests that [require a review](/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging) before they can be merged: `state:open type:pr review:required`
- Filter pull requests that a reviewer has approved: `state:open type:pr review:approved`
- Filter pull requests in which a reviewer has asked for changes: `state:open type:pr review:changes_requested`
- Filter pull requests by [reviewer](/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/): `state:open type:pr reviewed-by:octocat`
- Filter pull requests by the specific user [requested for review](/articles/requesting-a-pull-request-review): `state:open type:pr review-requested:octocat`
- Filter pull requests by the team requested for review: `state:open type:pr team-review-requested:github/atom`{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" or currentVersion ver_gt "enterprise-server@2.20" or currentVersion == "github-ae@latest" %}
- Filter for pull requests that are linked to an issue that the pull request may close: `linked:issue`{% endif %}
