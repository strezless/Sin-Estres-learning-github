Anyone with write permissions to a repository can assign issues and pull requests.

You can assign up to 10 people to each issue or pull request, including yourself, anyone who has commented on the issue or pull request, anyone with write permissions to the repository, and organization members with read permissions to the repository. For more information, see "[Access permissions on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}](/articles/access-permissions-on-github)."
