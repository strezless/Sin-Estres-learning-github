You can open a new issue based on code from an existing pull request. For more information, see "[Opening an issue from code](/github/managing-your-work-on-github/opening-an-issue-from-code)."

You can open a new issue directly from a comment in an issue or a pull request review. For more information, see "[Opening an issue from a comment](/github/managing-your-work-on-github/opening-an-issue-from-a-comment)."

{% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" or currentVersion ver_gt "enterprise-server@2.19" or currentVersion == "github-ae@latest" %}
{% tip %}

**Tip**: You can also create an issue using the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %}. For more information, see "[`gh issue create`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_issue_create)" in the {% data variables.product.prodname_cli %} documentation.

{% endtip %}

If you're using a project board to track and prioritize your work, you can convert project board notes to issues. For more information, see "[About project boards](/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards)" and "[Adding notes to a project board](/github/managing-your-work-on-github/adding-notes-to-a-project-board#converting-a-note-to-an-issue)."

{% tip %}

**Tips**: Project maintainers can choose to:
  - Create an issue template for a repository. Templates include prompts for information in the body of an issue. For more information, see "[About issue and pull request templates](/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)."
  - Disable issues for a repository. For more information, see "[Disabling issues](/github/managing-your-work-on-github/disabling-issues)." Pull requests can't be turned off and are always available.
