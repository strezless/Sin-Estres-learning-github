title: Keeping your local repository in sync with GitHub
intro: 'You can keep your local repository in sync with your remote repository as you make changes to either one. In Git, a *remote* is the server where your code is stored. In your case, that server is a repository on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} or {% data variables.product.prodname_enterprise %}.'
