### Configuring a workflow to run manually

To run a workflow manually, the workflow must be configured to run on the `workflow_dispatch` event. For more information about configuring the `workflow_dispatch` event, see "[Events that trigger workflows](/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch)".

### Running a workflow on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}

To trigger the `workflow_dispatch` event on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, your workflow must be in the default branch. Follow these steps to manually trigger a workflow run.

### Running a workflow using the REST API

When using the REST API, you configure the `inputs` and `ref` as request body parameters. If the inputs are omitted, the default values defined in the workflow file are used.

For more information about using the REST API, see the "[Create a workflow dispatch event](/rest/reference/actions/#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event)."
