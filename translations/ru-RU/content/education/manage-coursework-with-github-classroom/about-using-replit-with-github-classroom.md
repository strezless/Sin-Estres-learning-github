### About Repl.it

Repl.it is an online integrated development environment (IDE) that supports multiple programming languages. Students can write, edit, run, test, and debug code in a browser with Repl.it. For more information about online IDEs and {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}, see "[Integrate {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} with an online IDE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-online-ide)."

{% data reusables.classroom.readme-contains-button-for-online-ide %}

The first time the student clicks the button to visit Repl.it, the student must sign into Repl.it with {% data variables.product.product_name %} credentials. After signing in, the student will have access to a development environment containing the code from the assignment repository, fully configured on Repl.it.

For more information about working on Repl.it, see the [Repl.it Quickstart Guide](https://docs.repl.it/misc/quick-start#the-repl-environment).

For group assignments, students can use Repl.it Multiplayer to work collaboratively. For more information, see the [Repl.it Multiplayer](https://repl.it/site/multiplayer) website.

### About submission of assignments with Repl.it

By default, Repl.it is configured to push to the assignment repository on {% data variables.product.product_location %}. After making progress on an assignment with Repl.it, students should push changes to {% data variables.product.product_location %} using the version control functionality in the left sidebar.
