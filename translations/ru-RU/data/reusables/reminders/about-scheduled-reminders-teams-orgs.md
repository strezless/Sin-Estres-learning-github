Scheduled reminders help teams focus on the most important review requests that require their attention. Scheduled reminders for pull requests will send a message to your team in Slack with all open pull requests that you or your team have been asked to review, at a specified time. For example, you can create a scheduled reminder to send a message to your team's main communication channel in Slack, including all open pull requests that the team is requested to review, every Wednesday at 9:00 a.m.
