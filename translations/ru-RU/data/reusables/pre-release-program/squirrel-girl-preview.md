**Note:** APIs for managing reactions are currently available for developers to preview. See the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-05-12-reactions-api-preview) for full details. To access the API during the preview period, you must provide a custom [media type](/v3/media) in the `Accept` header:

  ```
  application/vnd.github.squirrel-girl-preview+json
  ```
 {% endnote %}
