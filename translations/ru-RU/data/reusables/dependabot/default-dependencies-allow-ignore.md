By default all dependencies that are explicitly defined in a manifest or lock file are kept up to date. You can use `allow` and `ignore` to customize which dependencies to maintain with version updates. {% data variables.product.prodname_dependabot %} checks for all allowed dependencies and then filters out any ignored dependencies or versions. So a dependency that is matched by both an `allow` and an `ignore` will be ignored.
