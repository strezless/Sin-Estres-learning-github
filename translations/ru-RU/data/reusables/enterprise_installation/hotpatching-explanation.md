You can upgrade {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} to the latest patch release using a hotpatch, which does not require a maintenance window and usually does not require a reboot. You can use hotpatching to upgrade to a newer patch release, but not a feature release. For example, you can upgrade from `2.10.1` to `2.10.5` because they are in the same feature series, but not from `2.10.9` to `2.11.0` because they are in a different feature series.
