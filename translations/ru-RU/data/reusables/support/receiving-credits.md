### Receiving credits for missed responses to support tickets

If you don't receive an initial response within the guaranteed response time to more than four tickets in a given quarter based on {% data variables.product.company_short %}'s fiscal year, you're eligible for a credit. To honor the SLA, {% data variables.product.company_short %} will refund 20% of the quarterly {% data variables.contact.premium_support %} fee in cash. To receive the refund, you must submit a credit request.

The credit request must be made within 30 days of the end of the quarter during which {% data variables.contact.premium_support %} did not respond to your tickets within the designated response time. Credit requests will not be honored if the respective deadline has passed. Once the respective deadline passes, you have waived the ability to claim a refund for the qualified credit.

To receive a refund, you must submit a completed credit request to <supportcredits@github.com>. To be eligible, the credit request must:
- Be sent from an email address associated with your {% data variables.product.product_name %} account
- Be received by {% data variables.product.company_short %} by the end of the 30th day after the quarter in which the four qualifying credits occurred
- Include "Credit Request" in the subject line

The following information **must be included** in your credit request:
- **Date** (The date must be within 30 days after the quarter based on {% data variables.product.company_short %}â€™s fiscal year end in which the claims occurred [January 31, April 30, July 31, or October 31].)
- **Customer contact** (You must specify both name and email address.)
- **Customer address**
- **Qualifying credits** (You must provide the date of each qualifying credit and the associated ticket number.){% if currentVersion == "free-pro-team@latest" %}
- **Name of {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_cloud %} organization**{% endif %}
- **Ticket numbers**
