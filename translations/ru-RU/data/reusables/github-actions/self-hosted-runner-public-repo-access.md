**Note:** For security reasons, public repositories can't use runners in a runner group by default, but you can override this in the runner group's settings. For more information, see "[Managing access to self-hosted runners using groups](/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups#changing-the-access-policy-of-a-self-hosted-runner-group)."
