When you synchronize a {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} team with an IdP group, changes to the IdP group are reflected on {% data variables.product.product_name %} automatically, reducing the need for manual updates and custom scripts. You can use an IdP with team synchronization to manage administrative tasks such as onboarding new members, granting new permissions for movements within an organization, and removing member access to the organization.
