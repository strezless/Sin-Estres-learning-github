If you are using a {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} workflow, you can use a `GITHUB_TOKEN` to publish and consume packages in {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} without needing to store and manage a personal access token. For more information, see "[Authenticating with the `GITHUB_TOKEN`](/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/authenticating-with-the-github_token)."
