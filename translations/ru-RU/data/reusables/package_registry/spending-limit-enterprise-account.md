If you pay for your enterprise account by invoice, you cannot manage the spending limit for your enterprise account on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. If you want to allow organizations owned by your enterprise account to use {% data variables.product.prodname_registry %} beyond the storage or data transfer included in their accounts, you can prepay for overages. Because overages must prepaid, you cannot enable unlimited spending on accounts paid by invoice. Your spending limit will be 150% of the amount you prepaid. If you have any questions, [contact our account management team](https://enterprise.github.com/contact).
