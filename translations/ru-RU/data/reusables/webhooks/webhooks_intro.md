When configuring a webhook, you can use the UI or API to choose which events will send you payloads. Only subscribing to the specific events you plan on handling limits the number of HTTP requests to your server. You can also subscribe to all current and future events. By default, webhooks are only subscribed to the push event. You can change the list of subscribed events anytime.
