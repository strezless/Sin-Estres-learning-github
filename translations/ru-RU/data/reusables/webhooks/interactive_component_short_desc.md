Triggered when a user clicks an interactive element that was created using the {% data variables.product.prodname_component_kit %}. {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}s are automatically subscribed to the `interactive_component` event so there's no need to manually subscribe to this event. Unlike other webhook events, the `interactive_component` event is only sent to the {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} that a user interacted with through an interactive component, such as in a composable comment. {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %}s cannot subscribe to the `interactive_component` event and other installed {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %}s will not receive the webhook event even if they subscribed to `interactive_component`.
