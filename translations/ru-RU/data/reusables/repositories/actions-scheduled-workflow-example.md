You can schedule a workflow to run at specific UTC times using [POSIX cron syntax](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07). Scheduled workflows run on the latest commit on the default or base branch. The shortest interval you can run scheduled workflows is once every 5 minutes.

This example triggers the workflow every day at 5:30 and 17:30 UTC:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    # * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
    - cron:  '*/30 5,17 * * *'

```
