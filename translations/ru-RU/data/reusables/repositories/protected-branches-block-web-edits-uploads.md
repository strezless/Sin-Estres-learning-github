If a repository has any protected branches, you can't edit or upload files in the protected branch using {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}. For more information, see "[About protected branches](/articles/about-protected-branches)."

You can use {% data variables.product.prodname_desktop %} to move your changes to a new branch and commit them. For more information, see "[Committing and reviewing changes to your project](/desktop/contributing-to-projects/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project)."
