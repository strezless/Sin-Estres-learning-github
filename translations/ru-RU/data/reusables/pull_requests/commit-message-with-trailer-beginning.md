1. Type your commit message and a short, meaningful description of your changes. After your commit description, instead of a closing quotation, add two empty lines.
  ```shell
  $ git commit -m "Refactor usability tests.
  >
  >
  ```
  {% tip %}

  **Tip:** If you're using a text editor on the command line to type your commit message, ensure there are two newlines between the end of your commit description and the `Co-authored-by:` commit trailer.

  {% endtip %}
