{% tip %}

**Note:** Locking a repository prevents users from pushing to the repository or modifying a repository's resources, like issues, labels, milestones, wikis, and comments. New teams and collaborators can't be associated with a locked repository.

If you're performing a trial run, you don't need to lock repositories. Otherwise, it's highly recommended. For more information, see "[About Migrations](/enterprise/admin/migrations/about-migrations#types-of-migrations)."
