A load balancer design uses a network device to direct Git and HTTP traffic to individual {% data variables.product.prodname_ghe_server %} appliances. You can use a load balancer to restrict direct traffic to the appliance for security purposes or to redirect traffic if needed without DNS record changes. We strongly recommend using a TCP-based load balancer that supports the PROXY protocol.
