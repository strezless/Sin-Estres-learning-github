{% note %}

**Note:** This guide demonstrates the app development process using the Ruby programming language. However, there are many [flavors of Octokit](/rest/overview/libraries). If you prefer JavaScript, you can use [Probot](https://probot.github.io/) and [Node.js](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/) to develop GitHub Apps.
