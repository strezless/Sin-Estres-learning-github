Sponsorships may be eligible for matching within the limitations stated here for the first year that an individual is a participant in {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}. Eligibility for matching begins after {% data variables.product.company_short %} admits an account to {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}, which publishes the sponsorship profile for the account. The matching period cannot be extended for any reason. If you leave {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %} and rejoin later, the gap between your participation periods may count toward your matching period or your matching period may expire.
