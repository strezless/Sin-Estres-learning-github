You can create up to ten sponsorship tiers for sponsors to choose from. Each tier has its own monthly payment amount in US dollars and benefits, such as receiving early access to new versions or being featured in the project's README.

Once you have a sponsor on a tier, you can't edit the price of that tier. Instead, you must retire the tier and create a new tier. Existing sponsors will remain on the retired tier until they change their sponsorship tier or cancel their sponsorship.
